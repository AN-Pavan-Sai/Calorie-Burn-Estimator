# FitPredict – Calorie Burn Estimation App

FitPredict is a lightweight web application that provides estimated calorie burn values based on limited, realistic workout inputs.

# Project Overview

FitPredict helps users get a rough idea of how many calories they may burn during a workout session using common inputs such as workout type and duration. The application is designed to be:

Easy to use

Transparent in its assumptions

Suitable for everyday users

# Key Features

Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

Calorie burn estimation based on workout details

Simple and clean user experience

Fast response and lightweight execution

# Estimation Approach

The app estimates calorie burn by identifying patterns in historical workout data and relating them to user-provided inputs. The focus is on providing reasonable approximations, not exact values.

Because individual effort levels and conditions can vary, results are presented as estimates rather than precise measurements.
